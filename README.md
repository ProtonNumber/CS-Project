# CS-Project
My A-Level CS project. A web app for teaching maths. Or at least very basic maths... I never got very far with it.

Designed to run using XAMPP, but this should run on anything with an SQL server. I'll need to figure out how that was set up.

The main thing I was proud of here was the ability to load and unload tasks, which presumably would be useful if there was more than a handful of tasks.
